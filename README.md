A tool-set for prototyping and implementing usable 
programming languages with dynamic type system


INTRODUCTION
------------

The project was as the backend and virtual machine parts of 
another programming language 
and been separated and restarted as a new project for
the following purpose:

1. Create a virtual machine with rich features to discovery a sutable
architecture with effective instrument-set for running dynamic-type 
programming languages.
2. Create a framework and a series of tools to provide an easy and clear
way for designers of programming languages to create a usable prototype 
and verify their ideas.
3. Create a platform for people who use different programming languages
to cooperate and communicate together.
